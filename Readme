Assignment: G2 - OpenCV Mosaic

I really enjoyed this assignment. I found this assignment bit easier than what we have done so far in the course because of the skeleton code given to us. 

I ran the program on tux and it works perfectly fine, without any errors.
For testing purposes, I also pushed phil.jpg image on bit-bucket.
I didn't pushed hw3ex to avoid the confusion  because when you type make, it generates it already. 

In total, I pushed the following:
1. SRC
2. Makefile
3.phil.jpg
4.lib
5.Readme

To run the program on tux, do the following:
	type: "make" and hit enter key.

I additionally took help from my fellow class mates in order to finish this assignment.
